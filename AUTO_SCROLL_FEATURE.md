# Auto-Scroll Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added ChatGPT-style auto-scrolling functionality to the chat interface. The chat now automatically scrolls to follow new messages as they appear, whether sent by the user or the AI.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Smooth Auto-Scroll**
- Messages automatically scroll into view when sent or received
- Uses smooth scrolling animation for better UX
- Implemented using `scroll-behavior: smooth` CSS and JavaScript `scrollTo()` with behavior option

### 2. **Smart Scroll Detection**
- Detects when user manually scrolls up to read previous messages
- Pauses auto-scrolling when user is reading older messages
- Automatically resumes when user scrolls near the bottom (within 150px threshold)
- Re-enables auto-scroll when user sends a new message

### 3. **Scroll-to-Bottom Button**
- Floating button appears when user has scrolled up
- Similar to ChatGPT's UI pattern
- Button smoothly animates in/out
- One-click returns to latest messages
- Automatically hides when at bottom of chat

### 4. **Improved Typing Indicator**
- Typing indicator now triggers smooth scroll
- Shows "กำลังคิด..." (Thinking...) with animation
- Keeps the AI response visible as it appears

## Technical Changes

### JavaScript (`static/js/chat.js`)
- Added `shouldAutoScroll` state tracking
- Created `smoothScrollToBottom()` function for smooth scrolling
- Added `isScrolledToBottom()` to detect scroll position
- Implemented `handleScroll()` to track user scroll behavior
- Added `scrollToBottomClick()` for manual scroll button
- Enhanced message appending to trigger auto-scroll
- Re-enables auto-scroll when user sends messages

### CSS (`static/css/chat.css`)
- Added `scroll-behavior: smooth` to `.chat-log`
- Created `.scroll-to-bottom-btn` styling with smooth animations
- Button has hover and active states
- Positioned absolutely at bottom center
- Smooth fade in/out with transform transitions

### HTML (`templates/chat.html`)
- Added scroll-to-bottom button element
- Included SVG down arrow icon
- Properly positioned within chat-log container

## User Experience

### When User Sends Message:
1. Message appears immediately
2. Chat smoothly scrolls to show the new message
3. Typing indicator appears
4. Chat stays scrolled to bottom for AI response

### When AI Responds:
1. Typing indicator shows "กำลังคิด..."
2. AI message replaces typing indicator
3. Chat auto-scrolls to show response
4. User can read without manual scrolling

### When User Scrolls Up:
1. Auto-scroll pauses automatically
2. Scroll-to-bottom button appears
3. User can read previous messages
4. Click button or send new message to resume auto-scroll

## Browser Compatibility
- Uses modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- Smooth scrolling supported in all modern browsers
- Gracefully degrades in older browsers (instant scroll instead of smooth)

## Testing Recommendations
1. Send multiple messages and verify auto-scroll
2. Scroll up manually and check button appears
3. Click scroll-to-bottom button
4. Send message while scrolled up (should auto-scroll)
5. Test on mobile devices
6. Verify smooth animations work

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Add unread message count on scroll-to-bottom button
- Sound notification for new messages when scrolled up
- Keyboard shortcut (End key) to jump to bottom
- Persistent scroll position on page refresh
